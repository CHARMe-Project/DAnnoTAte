# envhack15-ui
User interface code for CHARMe demonstrator developed at EnviroHack2015 (http://www.digitalcatapultcentre.org.uk/event/envirohack-2015/).

See docs directory for a PowerPoint overview presentation

Open http://jonblower.github.io/envhack15-ui/ for a demo (works best in Chrome, because other browsers don't like the mixed content, http: and https:)

See annotations directory for the Turtle files we used to create annotations on the CHARMe server.
